> The multi-stage query architecture and its SQL-task engine are experimental features available starting in Druid 24.0. You can use it in place of the existing native batch and Hadoop based ingestion systems. As an experimental feature, functionality documented on this page is subject to change or removal in future releases. Review the release notes and this page to stay up to date on changes.

All authenticated users can use the SQL-task engine through the UI and API if the extension is loaded. However, without additional permissions, users are not able to issue queries that read or write Druid datasources or external data. The permission you need depends on what you are trying to do.

## General permissions

The permission required to submit a query depends on the type of query:

  - SELECT from a Druid datasource requires the READ DATASOURCE permission on that
  datasource.
  - INSERT or REPLACE into a Druid datasource requires the WRITE DATASOURCE permission on that
  datasource.
  - EXTERN references to external data require READ permission on the resource name "EXTERNAL" of the resource type "EXTERNAL". Users without the correct permission encounter a 403 error when trying to run queries that include EXTERN.

Task queries that you submit to the SQL-task engine are Overlord tasks, so they follow the Overlord's (indexer) model. This means that users with access to the Overlord API can perform some actions even if they didn't submit the query. The actions include retrieving the status or canceling a query. For more information about the Overlord API and the SQL-task API, see [API](./msq-reference.md#context-parameters).

To interact with a query through the Overlord API, you need the following permissions:

- INSERT or REPLACE queries: You must have READ DATASOURCE permission on the output datasource.
- SELECT queries: You must have read permissions on the `__query_select` datasource, which is a stub datasource that gets created.


## S3

If you enable durable storage for mesh shuffle with Amazon S3 as the storage, you need the following S3 permissions:
- Permissions for pushing and fetching intermediate stage results to and from S3:
  - `s3:GetObject`
  - `s3:PutObject`
  - `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`
- Permissions for removing intermediate stage results:
  - `s3:DeleteObject`
