/**
 * {@link HeapQuickSelectSketch} doesn't publicaly provide a way to update it directly with a hashed value - where the
 * hashed value is equivalent to what the sketch would've also calculated on its own.
 * We needed that functionality since we're calculating the hashes outside the sketch to re-use it at multiple places
 * including the sketch itself. Hence, we've extended the HeapQuickSelectSketch class to use its package-private method
 * {@link HeapQuickSelectSketch#hashUpdate(long)}.
